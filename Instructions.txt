To run this app locally: 
You need to run both the front and backend together.

1. Open one terminal in VS code.
- Rename this terminal "Frontend"
- Using ls/cd commands go into:  ManageMyLunch -> frontend 
- Type in the terminal: npm run dev
- The frontend should now be running on http://localhost:5173/
- You may be asked to install missing packages, do so.
    - If you see an error about nodemon use sudo npm install -g nodemon
    OR
    - If you see an error saying sh: vite: command not found. Use this command: npm install --legacy-peer-deps
- Do not close or kill this terminal

2. Open another terminal in VS code
- Rename this terminal "Backend"
- Using ls/cd commands go into:  ManageMyLunch -> backend
- Type in the terminal: npm run app
- The backend should now be running on port 8082, you should see a confirmation message
- You should also see "Success! MongoDB is connected..."
    - If you dont see this confirmation message, MongoDB is not connected and is likely because you need to add your IP address in MongoDB dashboard.
    OR 
    - If you dont see a confirmation message, its possible you are using an outdated db.js file. Check team discord for the latest.
- Do not close or kill this terminal

Otherwise see Tyler for help
