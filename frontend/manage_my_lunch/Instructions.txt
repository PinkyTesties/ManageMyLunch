To run this app locally: 
You need to run both the front and backend together.

1. Open one terminal in VS code.
- Rename this terminal "Frontend"
- Using ls/cd commands go into:  ManageMyLunch -> frontend -> manage_my_lunch
- Type in the terminal: npm run dev
- The frontend should now be running on http://localhost:5173/
- You may be asked to install missing packages, do so.
- Do not close or kill this terminal

2. Open another terminal in VS code
- Rename this terminal "Backend"
- In the termainal go into ManageMyLunch folder
- Type in the terminal: npm run app
    - If you see an error about nodemon use sude npm install -g nodemon
- The backend should now be running on port 8082, you should see a confirmation message
- You should also see "Success! MongoDB is connected..."
    - If you dont see this confirmation message, MongoDB is not connected and is likely because you need to add your IP address in MongoDB dashboard
- Do not close or kill this terminal

Otherwise see Tyler for help
